libwebcam Webcam Library and tools
==================================

Introduction
------------

The libwebcam package contains the following two components:
- libwebcam - Webcam Library
- uvcdynctrl - Manage dynamic controls in uvcvideo

This README file contains information that is common to all of the above
components. For component specific information please refer to the README
files in Libs/libwebcam and Apps/uvcdynctrl.


Versions
--------

Note that the latest versions of the Webcam Library, its API documentation, and
uvcdynctrl can always be found at the following address:

Building
--------

External dependencies:
- uvcvideo (Linux UVC driver)
- libxml2
- gengetopt

Important note on the uvcvideo and gengetopt dependencies:

The configure script does not currently check for the existence of gengetopt.
Make sure you install it before running 'make', otherwise your build will fail.
This may be fixed in a future release.

Unless the USE_UVCVIDEO constant is disabled (it is enabled by default),
libwebcam needs two header files from the Linux UVC driver. If you don't
already have them on your hard disk, you can download them from the uvcvideo
project's home page at http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ or directly from the
Subversion repository at:
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/

You must copy or link uvcvideo.h and uvc_compat.h into the /Common/include/
directory, e.g. using the following commands:

cd Common/include/
ln -s ~/uvcvideo/trunk/uvcvideo.h
ln -s ~/uvcvideo/trunk/uvc_compat.h

or

cd Common/include/
wget http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/uvcvideo.h
wget http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/uvc_compat.h

Once you have those two files you can continue as normal.

The build system is based on CMake. Because of the way CMake works, Makefiles
do not ship with libwebcam, so you have to have CMake installed. Don't worry,
though, you are likely to have a lot less illegible error messages than with
the previous GNU Automake.

Once you have CMake installed you can build and install it by running the
following commands in the libwebcam source directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
