libwebcam Webcam Library and tools
==================================

Introduction
------------

The libwebcam package contains the following two components:
- libwebcam - Webcam Library
- uvcdynctrl - Manage dynamic controls in uvcvideo

This README file contains information that is common to all of the above
components. For component specific information please refer to the README
files in Libs/libwebcam and Apps/uvcdynctrl.


Versions
--------

Note that the latest versions of the Webcam Library, its API documentation, and
uvcdynctrl can always be found at the following address:

Building
--------

External dependencies:
- uvcvideo (Linux UVC driver)
- libxml2
- gengetopt (optional)

Important note on the uvcvideo dependency:

Unless the USE_UVCVIDEO constant is disabled (it is enabled by default),
libwebcam needs two header files from the Linux UVC driver. If you don't
already have them on your hard disk, you can download them from the uvcvideo
project's home page at http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ or directly from the
Subversion repository at:
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/

You must copy or link uvcvideo.h and uvc_compat.h into the /Common/include/
directory, e.g. using the following commands:

cd Common/include/
ln -s ~/uvcvideo/trunk/uvcvideo.h
ln -s ~/uvcvideo/trunk/uvc_compat.h

or

cd Common/include/
wget http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/uvcvideo.h
wget http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/uvc_compat.h

Once you have those two files you can continue as normal.

The uvcdynctrl directory ships with the two files cmdline.[ch]. As long as
those are present, gnugetopt is not required. If they are missing, the build
system will try to create them with the help of gnugetopt.

The build system is based on CMake. Because of the way CMake works, Makefiles
do not ship with libwebcam, so you have to have CMake installed. Don't worry,
though, you are likely to have a lot less illegible error messages than with
the previous GNU Automake.

Once you have CMake installed you can build and install it by running the
following commands in the libwebcam source directory:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install (as root)

You need at least CMake 2.4.4 in order for the Libxml2 detection to work.

CMake defaults to installing binaries and libraries to /usr/local. To use a
different install prefix, you can replace the above 'cmake' command with the
following:

cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

If you prefer to leave the prefix alone, you should make sure that
/usr/local/bin is in your path and LD_LIBRARY_PATH contains the /usr/local/lib
directory.
