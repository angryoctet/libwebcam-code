libwebcam Webcam Library
========================

Introduction
------------

The Webcam Library libwebcam is designed to simplify the development of webcam
applications, primarily on Linux but with an option to be ported to other
platforms, in particular Solaris. It realizes part of what the unwritten
Video4Linux user space library was always supposed to be: an easy to use
library that shields its users from many of the difficulties and problems of
using the V4L2 API directly.

Today libwebcam provides the following core features:

* Enumeration of all cameras available in the system.
* Provide detailed information about the detected devices and their controls.
* Wrapper for the V4L2 frame format enumeration.
* Convenient access to device controls.
* Support for configuring the Linux UVC driver's dynamic controls (extension
  unit controls).

In addition, the interface is prepared to handle device events ranging from
newly detected cameras over control value changes to device button events.
It is easy to add new features without breaking application compatibility and
the addition of new controls or events is straightforward.

Change log:

0.1: Initial release


Building
--------

External dependencies:
- uvcvideo (Linux UVC driver)
- libxml2
- gengetopt

Important note on the uvcvideo and gengetopt dependencies:

The configure script does not currently check for the existence of gengetopt.
Make sure you install it before running 'make', otherwise your build will fail.
This may be fixed in a future release.

Unless the USE_UVCVIDEO constant is disabled (it is enabled by default),
libwebcam needs two header files from the Linux UVC driver. If you don't
already have them on your hard disk, you can download them from the uvcvideo
project's home page at http://linux-uvc.berlios.de/ or directly from the
Subversion repository at:
http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/

You must copy or link uvcvideo.h and uvc_compat.h into the /Common/include/
directory, e.g. using the following commands:

cd Common/include/
ln -s ~/uvcvideo/trunk/uvcvideo.h
ln -s ~/uvcvideo/trunk/uvc_compat.h

or

cd Common/include/
wget http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/uvcvideo.h
wget http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/linux-uvc/linux-uvc/trunk/uvc_compat.h

Once you have those two files you can continue as normal.

The build system is currently based on GNU Automake, so you should be able to
build and install it by running the following commands in the top-level
directory:

./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
